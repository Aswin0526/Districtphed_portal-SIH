Threshold-Based Detection:

A sensor system continuously measures the chlorine content in drinking water.
If the content exceeds or falls below the set threshold, the transmitter sends the data (chlorine content, location, and kit ID) to a Firebase database via an ESP32 microcontroller.
Automated Alerts to PHED:

When a new record is added to the database, it indicates unsafe chlorine levels in drinking water for that specific location.
An automated email alert is sent to the districtâ€™s Public Health Engineering Department (PHED), notifying them of the issue and its exact location.
PHED Response and Resolution:

PHED investigates the affected area and resolves the issue.
After resolution, PHED is required to submit a proof document via an online form in the web application.
Acknowledgment by Higher Authorities:

The submitted form is shared with higher officials, such as the District Collector, who acknowledge the work done by PHED.
Once acknowledged, the unresolved problem is marked as resolved in the system.
